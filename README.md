# Supervised Machine Learning Homework - Predicting Credit Risk

In this analysis, I built a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan from LendingClub will become high risk or not.

# Background

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.
I will be using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, I will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.
